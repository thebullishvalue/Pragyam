"""
PRAGYAM — Portfolio Intelligence (Streamlit App)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Covariance-based portfolio curation over a fixed ETF universe.

Architecture:
  nco.py            → Equal Weight / ERC / HRP / Conviction-Value Grid curation
  pragati.py        → pragati.pine's conviction tape and histogram
  cvgrid.py         → the Conviction-Value Grid: states and graded map
  samanvaya.py      → Samanvaya's value tape (the macro-hedged value engine)
  regime.py         → MarketRegimeDetector (fixed 8-factor) — context only
  backdata.py       → generate_historical_data(), compute_volume_profile()
  analytics.py      → portfolio-vs-benchmark performance metrics
  charts.py         → Plotly chart builders
  universe.py       → universe resolution

What this system does NOT do, and why
─────────────────────────────────────
It carries no conviction score, no strategy library and no weight calibration.
All three were removed after measurement, not preference:

  · the conviction blend had no cross-sectional predictive power on this
    universe (IC ~0.00-0.04, sign unstable across horizons);
  · the 95-strategy library was 97.2% self-correlated — an effective count of
    1.03 independent strategies out of 92, because long-only baskets of assets
    that are themselves 52% correlated cannot decorrelate;
  · per-regime weight calibration could not clear its own significance gate.

Grinold's Fundamental Law bounds excess return from FORECASTING at
IR = IC x sqrt(BR) x TC — roughly 1%/yr here, since 30 ETFs at rho 0.517 are
only ~1.9 effective independent bets. Rather than keep chasing that bound, the
system allocates from the covariance structure, which is estimable where
expected returns are not. It targets RISK, and is honest that it does not
deliver excess return: measured across two disjoint periods, HRP gives up
~1%/yr against equal weight and buys a ~20% cut in volatility and drawdown.

Pipeline:
  Phase 1: Data fetching + regime detection (context)
  Phase 2: Covariance curation (Equal Weight, ERC, HRP or Conviction-Value Grid)

Result tabs: Portfolio (holdings + risk profile + cluster structure) ·
Analytics (book vs benchmark vs equal-weight shadow vs the other styles'
books from the same run) · Regime ·
Broker Sync (curated units → broker JSONs) · System.
