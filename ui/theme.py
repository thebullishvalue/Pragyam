"""
PRAGYAM — Shared CSS, chart theming, and colour constants for the UI layer.
प्रज्ञम् (Pragyam) — "Discernment / Wisdom"

UI — Institutional research terminal design language.

Aesthetic: "Graphite" — near-achromatic ground, semantic colour only
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Display/UI:  Inter (prose, headings, labels)
- Body/Data:   JetBrains Mono (tabular numerals — every figure in the app)
- Ground:      Graphite (#0A0C10 -> #1C212A), deliberately neutral. The
               predecessor ramp was Obsidian with an amber-gold accent, which
               tinted every panel warm and forced the semantic hues to
               compete with the brand for the same attention.
- Semantic:    Cobalt #4C7DF0 (interactive), Green #2CA36B (carries less
               variance than capital), Red #DD5A5A (carries more), Amber
               #D79A3C (caution ONLY), Steel #4E9FC4 (info). Muted, not the
               stock Tailwind-500 ramp; each clears WCAG AA on every surface
               it is used on.
- Surfaces:    Flat, told apart by a hairline border and one step of tone.
               No blur, no stacked shadows — a shadow is spent on overlays.
- Themes:      Slate (dark, canonical) and Paper (light, for reading and
               print). The light theme is a token swap, not a second
               stylesheet — see LIGHT_TOKENS below.

Ported from TATTVA, the sibling terminal, so the two apps share one grammar.

/* ── What can NOT be a token swap ────────────────────────────────────────
   Everything else Streamlit paints natively — nav links, button faces, input
   text and placeholders, the portalled menus and tooltips — is claimed in
   theme.css §16, in TOKENS, so one block serves both appearances. Those rules
   used to live here, which quietly made `.streamlit/config.toml` load-bearing:
   they were only needed because Streamlit's dark base happened to be right for
   Slate, so the day that base changed to match a Paper default, Slate lost all
   thirty-five of them at once. A rule that belongs to both themes belongs in
   the file both themes load.

   These two remain because they are genuinely light-only, not a swap:
   on paper the primary button's hover needs a DARKER accent (the dark theme's
   is lighter), and the rail reads better as the tinted surface with the
   content area white — the reverse of the dark theme's arrangement. */

   theme.css builds elevation by stepping UP the surface ramp: on graphite a
   raised thing is lighter, so a menu sits on --surface-2 and a button hover
   on --surface-3. On paper the ramp runs the other way — --surface-1 IS the
   white and every step above it is a deeper grey — so the same "raised"
   reading needs the ramp stepped DOWN. This is the second thing a token swap
   cannot express: what changes is the DIRECTION, not the value, and no single
   token name means "one step toward the light" in both. */
