PRAGYAM — Presentation helpers shared by the app shell and every tab.
प्रज्ञम् (Pragyam) — "Discernment / Wisdom"

The pieces of the UI layer that need to know something about the DOMAIN — how
a style is named, what an undefined figure looks like, which order the regime
factors are read in. They live here rather than in app.py because the tab
modules need them too, and a tab importing the shell it is rendered by is a
cycle waiting to happen.

Nothing here renders. Anything that emits markup belongs in ui/components.py.
