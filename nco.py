PRAGYAM — Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) / Equal Weight
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Covariance-based portfolio curation — the system's only curation stack. It
selects AND weights entirely from the return covariance structure, and makes no
return forecast of any kind.

Why covariance rather than forecasts
────────────────────────────────────
Grinold's Fundamental Law bounds excess return from FORECASTING skill at
IR = IC x sqrt(BR) x TC. Measured on the ETF universe that ceiling is ~1%/yr:
average pairwise correlation 0.517 leaves only ~1.9 effective independent bets,
so no amount of signal engineering buys much.

That bound applies to alpha from prediction. It does not apply here, because NCO
predicts nothing. It exploits the covariance structure, which is estimable from
a few hundred observations in a way expected returns never are (López de Prado,
"Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out of Sample", 2016; "A Robust
Estimator of the Efficient Frontier", 2019). That is why this stack can reduce
RISK reliably where forecast-driven approaches cannot — but see the measured
results below: it does not deliver excess return either.

Measured on the shipped module across two GENUINELY DISJOINT periods
(2023-12..2024-12 and 2025-01..2026-07, zero overlap):

    HRP vs equal weight:  return -0.96% / -1.23%      (loses in BOTH)
                          volatility 13.81->11.28%, 12.97->10.38%
                          max drawdown -6.89->-4.50%, -7.07->-6.15%
                          Sharpe 1.83->2.14, 0.96->1.07

This is a VOLATILITY-REDUCTION overlay, not an alpha source. It costs about
1%/yr of return and buys roughly a 20% cut in volatility and drawdown; Sharpe
improves because the risk saving outweighs the return cost. Do not size it
expecting excess return.

An earlier nested-window test (2024+ was fully contained in 2023+) reported a
small POSITIVE excess return. That did not survive a disjoint split — a caution
about the window design, not about the method.

HRP beats NCO on return, Sharpe and drawdown in both disjoint windows, and
inverts no matrix. Prefer HRP.

Corroboration that the correlation structure carries information beyond
variance alone: plain inverse-VOLATILITY weighting, which ignores correlation
entirely, also lost to equal weight when tested. (That test used the older
nested windows, so treat it as directional only, not as a like-for-like
comparison with the disjoint figures above.)

Why hierarchical
────────────────
Markowitz inverts the covariance matrix, and its condition number explodes when
assets are correlated — small estimation errors become wild weights. HRP inverts
nothing: it orders the matrix by cluster, then splits capital by recursive
bisection using only cluster variances. Ward clustering finds K ~= 3 here at
silhouette ~0.24, independently matching the eigenvalue participation ratio of
2.95 — three real risk clusters inside 30 tickers.

Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) and full Nested Clustered Optimization (NCO) were
both implemented and measured alongside HRP. ERC achieves perfect risk balance
(1.00x against HRP's 1.5-1.7x) but matched HRP on return and Sharpe to within
noise across both disjoint windows; NCO trailed HRP on return, Sharpe and
drawdown in both. Neither is carried — see CHANGELOG for the figures.

    of book weight they describe (1.0 for every covariance-driven style).

    A per-position cap is applied (relaxed to 1/n when n makes it infeasible),
    but NO floor: a floor would fight the method. The entire point is that a
