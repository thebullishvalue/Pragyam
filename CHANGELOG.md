## [10.0.1] - 2026-07-06

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Calibration was mathematically unreachable — it can now actually happen.**
  Phase 1.5 built its harvest from the 100-day `_REGIME_LOOKBACK_FILES`
  display panel: at most 90 harvest dates → 45 validation dates → at most
  **5** non-overlapping paired validation dates, while the paired
  significance gate requires **8** (`MIN_PAIRED_VAL_DATES`). Every
  calibration therefore burned 100 Optuna trials and then failed the gate,
  by construction — the display window and the statistical gate had never
  been reconciled. The fix sizes the data supply from the inference
  requirement instead of weakening any gate:
  - `intelligence.min_calibration_dates()` derives the in-family date count
    the gate implies (142 at the defaults: 8 paired dates × horizon 10 under
    a 50/50 split) — the documented data-supply contract.
  - New `app._CALIBRATION_LOOKBACK_FILES = 375` (~18 months): a dedicated,
    cached estimation panel fetched **only** when a scope actually needs
    calibrating (reused passports never pay for it). The regime card, chart,
    and curation stay on the fast 100-day panel. Regime-family labels for
    the harvest are computed over the estimation panel itself.
  - `calibrate()` now **fails fast on reachability** before the Optuna
    search: if the validation partition cannot possibly yield 8 paired
    dates, it reports the shortfall as the data requirement it is (with the
    family's actual date count and the required minimum) instead of burning
    100 trials and reporting what looked like sampling bad luck. All
    integrity rails (paired t-test, positive val-IR, shrinkage, embargo,
    non-overlapping stride) are unchanged — a regime family that genuinely
    lacks history still honestly refuses to calibrate.
- **Sidebar regime card (and passport card) froze on pre-run state after a
  completed analysis.** The sidebar paints before `_run_analysis` executes,
  and the only post-run repaint path was the calibration-success rerun —
  which never fired (see above). `main()` now issues one `st.rerun()` after
  the run flags are popped (cannot loop; the repaint pass is fully
  cache-hit), so the regime card, passport card, and result page always
  reflect the run that just finished.
- Beats-default failure message now quotes the actual gate threshold
  (`MIN_PAIRED_T_STAT = 1.895`); it previously said `t>=1.645`.
- **Manual Calibrate button (Intelligence tab) harvested from the 100-day run
  panel**, which the reachability gate makes a guaranteed fail — it now
  fetches the same `_CALIBRATION_LOOKBACK_FILES` estimation panel Phase 1.5
  uses (regime-conditioned over that panel), falling back to the run panel
  only if the estimation fetch comes up short.
- **Execution summary's "Total Duration" reported session age, not run
  time**: the per-session metrics tracker's `start_time` was never reset
  between runs. `_run_analysis` now resets the run clock alongside
  phases/errors/warnings.

- **F&O universe fetch always fell to the NIFTY 500 proxy**: NSE removed the
  "SECURITIES IN F&O" JSON index (hard 404), and the nsepython fallback used
  `nse_get_advances_declines()` — advance/decline breadth data, not the F&O
  list — silently mislabeled as F&O. The canonical **derivatives market-lots
  file** (`fo_mktlots.csv`, nsearchives host) is now the primary source, with
  structural validation of the payload (the legacy archives host answers
  HTTP 200 with a PDF error page) and a ≥100-symbol plausibility floor. The
  wrong-source nsepython fallback was removed; the NIFTY 500 last resort now
  labels itself honestly as a depth proxy.
- **Plot containers were clipped at the bottom with a phantom scrollbar**:
  `.stPlotlyChart` drew a real 1px border while Streamlit sizes that box to
  the exact figure height, so every chart overflowed by 2px — bottom corners
  cut square while the top rounded fine. The stroke is now an inset
  box-shadow ring (zero layout cost) and the inner wrapper clips rather than
  scrolls.
- **Section vertical rhythm was structurally broken**:
  `.section-hdr:first-child { margin-top: 0 }` matched EVERY header (each is
  the only child of its own stMarkdownContainer), silently zeroing the sp-10
  section break app-wide — real breaks degraded to Streamlit's ~1rem flex
  gap sitting next to 4–5rem divider/gap breaks (the "random dividers,
  uneven rhythm" symptom). The collapse now happens at the element-container
  level, so only a header that opens its tab panel/column sheds the margin.
  The divider-adjacency guard used `:has(> .section-divider)` — a
  direct-child combinator that can never match Streamlit's nested DOM —
  corrected to descendant form.

- **Analytics: chart legend and Benchmark card disagreed** — the Relative
  Performance chart's benchmark series was a bare `(1+r).cumprod()`, which
  starts at (1+r₁) on the first *return* date: the plotted line began one
  trading day after the portfolio line and the legend's `last/first − 1`
  silently dropped day 1's benchmark return, while the Benchmark Comparison
  card compounded the full series. The display series now anchors a 1.0 at
  the portfolio's base date, making the line, legend %, and card one number
  (verified to float precision).
- **Analytics: "CAGR" was not annualized for 20–251-day windows** — the
  annualization exponent was capped at 1 (`min(252/n_days, 1)`), so the
  "CAGR" subtext just repeated the raw period return under the wrong label,
  Calmar's numerator wasn't annualized, and the Info Ratio divided a
  period-return spread by an *annualized* tracking error (systematically
  understated for sub-year windows). CAGR/Alpha/Calmar/Info-Ratio now use
  true geometric annualization (252/n_days exponent) in both the headline
  and the aligned-alpha paths; the existing `cagr_meaningful` 60-day gate
  still keeps sub-quarter annualizations off the UI.

### 🎨 Improved

- **One rhythm doctrine — the section header owns the break** (documented on
  `_section_divider`). Removed the pre-header dividers (Portfolio →
  Conviction Signals, Position Guide table, Regime Score History, System
  Methodology, Analytics Returns) and pre-header `section_gap()`s (Analytics
  Benchmark Comparison, Risk Metrics), so every section boundary is the same
  sp-10 break. Dividers remain only at non-headered boundaries: KPI band →
  tab strip, heatmap → CSV action, tabs → footer, and the landing page's
  card blocks.
- **Single-bar, monotonic progress timeline.** All run milestones render into
  the one `progress_container` bar with strictly non-decreasing percentages,
  banded by phase: Phase 1 (Data & Regime) 0–20, Phase 1.5 (Intelligence)
  20–35 — every branch (ready/skipped/calibrated/failed) lands on 35 — and
  Phase 2 (Strategies & Curation) 35–100. Previously the bar jumped
  backwards (25 → 21 entering calibration, 28 → 25 entering Phase 2).
- **Milestones now state only what is true when shown, in Title Case.**
  "Running strategies · 95 strategies" (hardcoded, shown before discovery)
  became "Discovering Strategies" → "Running Strategies · {n} strategies";
  "Aggregating holdings" (shown *before* the strategy loop) was replaced by
  live in-loop updates ("Strategy {i}/{n} · {k} candidates", sweeping
  38→65); "Phase 1 Complete" now reports the detected regime and confidence
  instead of "Data acquisition ready".
- **Terminal log now mirrors the milestone trace.** Each phase logs a section
  with its load-bearing facts (panel size, detected regime, strategy /
  candidate / position counts), and the Phase 1.5 intelligence outcome —
  including the skip/fail *reason*, previously never printed — is logged via
  `_log_intel_outcome`. Execution-summary polish: phase timings print in
  Title Case (was raw `snake_case`), `total_execution` no longer double-lists
  inside its own breakdown, the backtest-only "Rebalances: 0" row is hidden
  on live runs, and Errors/Warnings section headers no longer render as
  "⚠️: Errors".

## [10.0.0] - 2026-07-02

### 🔍 Full-System Correctness & Rigor Audit

A comprehensive audit of every module (see `AUDIT_DIRECTIVES.md` for the full
finding-by-finding record) surfaced and resolved issues spanning calibration
integrity, data correctness, portfolio construction, analytics, infrastructure,
and UI truth-in-labeling. Every fix was empirically validated (statistical
false/true-positive rate tests, bit-identical numerical comparisons, or
end-to-end pipeline runs), not merely reviewed.

**Breaking / behavioral changes**

- `PASSPORT_VERSION` bumped to `v7-pragyam-conviction-strat`, auto-invalidating
  all prior passports (v4/v5/v6). Recalibration is required for every scope.
- Intelligence Mode will calibrate **less often** than before: a paired
  significance test now gates every passport save (see below), so a scope
  without a genuine, statistically-demonstrable edge over the 1/6×6 default
  will honestly report a skip reason instead of deploying a calibration.
- `portfolio.compute_conviction_based_weights`'s `dispersion_params` now
  expects a bare `gamma` float; a legacy `(boost, penalty)` tuple is still
  accepted for backward compatibility (only its first element is used).
- The dark/light theme toggle (never functional — see below) has been removed
  entirely; Obsidian Quant dark is now the only theme.

### ✨ Added

- **Strategy Endorsement** — a sixth conviction signal. Each of the 95
  strategies' own top-quartile picks (by its internal weighting) casts an
  "endorsement vote"; a symbol's cross-sectional percentile rank of votes
  becomes `strat_signal`. Previously every strategy's computed weights were
  discarded after aggregation and the union of "candidates" across 95
  strategies was ~= the entire data-valid universe, so the strategy layer
  contributed zero information to selection. `w_strat` cannot be calibrated
  historically (no historical vote data exists) and stays fixed at its
  default weight; the calibrator learns the other five signals on a 5-simplex
  scaled to fill the remaining mass.
- **Regime-family-conditioned calibration** — the calibration harvest is now
  filtered to dates that actually occurred in the target regime's FAMILY
  (Bull/Chop/Bear Mix) before any learning happens. Previously a passport
  keyed "BEAR" was estimated on the entire trailing window regardless of
  regime; the label distinguished only when a calibration happened to run.
- **Statistically-significant beats-default gate** — a passport is saved only
  when the learned weights beat the default baseline by a paired one-sample
  t-test on per-date IC differences (not a naive point-estimate IR
  comparison, which was found to accept ~40% of pure-noise calibrations at
  realistic validation-date counts). Deployed weights are shrunk toward the
  default in proportion to out-of-sample confidence.
- **Purged, non-overlapping IC estimation** — embargoes the train/val
  boundary and samples Information Coefficients on non-overlapping dates
  only, removing the serial-correlation bias that inflated the naive
  overlapping-window IR estimate.
- **Continuous power-law position dispersion** — `adjusted = conviction **
  gamma` replaces the median-step boost/penalty formula, which created up to
  a ~13x weight ratio between two candidates one conviction point apart.
- **Position-bound feasibility** — the 1%/10% bounds are automatically
  relaxed to the minimal value that restores feasibility when `num_positions`
  makes the nominal bounds mathematically unsatisfiable (e.g. 5 positions
  cannot all satisfy a 10% cap).
- **Frozen run context** — result tabs read the exact (universe, index,
  regime, mode, anchor date) a curated portfolio was produced under, not live
  sidebar state, so browsing the sidebar after a run can no longer re-score
  an already-curated portfolio under a different scope or resolve Analytics
  against the wrong benchmark.
- **Per-session execution metrics** — `metrics.get_metrics()` now returns a
  tracker scoped to `st.session_state` under Streamlit, so concurrent users
  no longer share/interleave phase timings, errors, and run IDs.
- Volume-dependent-signal coverage warning on the Portfolio tab, and an
  upfront warning when selecting the Currency universe (FX pairs report zero
  volume, so Oscillator/Z-Score/Value Area are structurally unavailable).
- `analytics.resolve_risk_free_rate` — resolves the risk-free rate to the
  benchmark's currency zone (6.5% INR vs 4.5% USD) instead of always using
  the INR rate.
- `AUDIT_DIRECTIVES.md` — the full audit record with literature citations.

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Benchmark resolution** for non-NIFTY universes (US Indexes, Commodities,
  Crypto, Currency) — the universe-level fallback map's keys never matched
  real universe strings, so every non-NIFTY book was silently benchmarked
  against NIFTY 50 in the Analytics tab.
- **Trading-day vs calendar-day warm-up** — indicator warm-up was measured in
  calendar days where trading days were required, leaving ~30% of every
  historical panel with NaN `ma200`/`ma90 weekly` still emitted as usable
  snapshots.
- **RSI warm-up mis-fill** — the "all-gains → RSI=100" backfill also stamped
  genuine warm-up NaN rows as a maximally-overbought 100.
- **Liquidity Oscillator warm-up contamination** — `fillna(1.0)` on the
  volume-moving-average and price-range guards fabricated large synthetic
  values instead of propagating NaN, contaminating roughly bars 20-40 of
  every symbol's oscillator.
- **Volume-profile NaN-bar crash** — a bar with valid close/volume but NaN
  high/low raised an uncaught `ValueError`, aborting the entire data-fetch
  phase for every symbol in the run, not just the offending one.
- **Volume-profile performance** — the per-window histogram build is now
  vectorized via a difference-array + cumsum (~4-5x faster, validated
  bit-identical to the original per-bar loop).
- Zero-signal symbols (absent from the live indicator snapshot) are excluded
  from top-N selection instead of competing at a neutral 50 conviction score.
- Weight-renormalization over available signals only, so a universe missing
  volume-dependent signals (FX, some futures) doesn't have its conviction
  range compressed toward 50 by structurally-dead weight slots.
- BBW volatility classification switched from absolute thresholds to
  percentile-within-window, so FX (tiny absolute BBW) and crypto (large
  absolute BBW) are read relative to their own normal range instead of being
  permanently mis-classified.
- CAGR/Alpha/Calmar cards are hidden (not silently mislabeled) when the
  return window is under 60 trading days — annualizing a sub-quarter window
  linearly extrapolates a few days of noise into a full year.
- Passport import now validates weights numerically and as a simplex
  (previously only checked key presence — `{"w_rsi": 37, ...}` imported
  without error) and rejects re-importing a defaults-shape export.
- India-index constituent fetching is now cached (`@st.cache_data`), fixing
  repeated NSE HTTP round-trips on every sidebar rerun.
- TLS verification restored by default on NSE archive requests (was
  unconditionally disabled); only relaxed as a last-resort retry on a genuine
  SSL failure.
- Removed the NIFTY 200 Wikipedia fallback that fabricated a "top 200" from
  an alphabetically-ordered constituent table.
- Single source of truth for the default ETF universe (`universe.ETF_UNIVERSE`;
  a divergent third hardcoded copy in `backdata.py` is gone).
- Broker Sync no longer zeroes a template's existing quantity when a matched
  holding was curated at 0 units — left untouched, like a non-match.
- Retry-with-backoff is now actually applied to the yfinance download (was
  imported but never wired in).
- Removed a 1.5s blocking `time.sleep` from the end of every successful run;
  strategy failures are now logged instead of silently swallowed.

### 🗑️ Removed

- Dead UI components with zero call sites: `render_theme_toggle` (ran inside
  a zero-height sandboxed iframe — was never clickable), `render_info_box`,
  `render_warning_box`, `render_chart_skeleton`, `render_collapsible_section`
  (+ `_close`), `render_export_button_row`, plus their corresponding dead CSS.
- The `[data-theme="light"]` CSS token/override blocks (unreachable given the
  removed toggle, and most components hard-code dark colors inline anyway).

## [9.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### 🎯 Regime Detector — Fixed Weights (No Calibration)

**Changed**

- The market-regime detector now uses **fixed 8-factor weights** (`regime.FACTOR_WEIGHTS`)
  — it is no longer calibrated. This adopts the legacy hardcoded-weighting design,
  retaining the current 8th `acceptance` (volume-profile) factor at a fixed weight.
  Only the **conviction blend** is calibrated (unchanged). Factor math, thresholds,
  and the regime hierarchy are identical to before.

**Removed**

- The entire regime-factor calibration layer: `intelligence.RegimeFactorPassport`,
  `calibrate_regime_factors`, `get_active_factor_weights`, `build_regime_harvest`,
  `_regime_ir`, `_softmaxN`, `regime_passport_filename`, `REGIME_PASSPORT_VERSION`,
  `REGIME_FACTOR_NAMES`, `DEFAULT_FACTOR_WEIGHTS`, `MIN_REGIME_DATES`;
  `regime.build_regime_factor_history` + `_resolve_factor_weights`; the Phase 1.4
  calibration step; and the `.passports/regimefactors_*.json` passport type.
- `MarketRegimeDetector.detect()` simplified — dropped the `(universe, index, mode)`
  parameters (regime is no longer scope/mode-dependent).

---

## [9.2.0] - 2026-07-01

### 📈 Analytics — Track the Curated Book vs Benchmark

**Added**

- **Analytics tab** — measures the LIVE curated portfolio's performance against a
  **universe-matched benchmark** (NIFTY 500 for nifty500, S&P 500 for us_sp500,
  NIFTY 50 default, etc.). Adapts the standalone SWING Analysis engine into a new
  `analytics.py` module. Core scope: a timeframe selector (1M…MAX / YTD), a
  normalized portfolio-vs-benchmark chart (indexed to 100), and metric-card rows
  for risk-adjusted (Period Return, CAGR, Alpha, Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, Info
  Ratio), risk (Volatility, Max Drawdown, VaR/CVaR, Beta, Tracking Error) and
  benchmark comparison (Benchmark/Excess return, Up/Down capture, Correlation, R²).
- `analytics.py` — `resolve_benchmark`, `fetch_analysis_data`, `compute_metrics`
  (behaviour-preserving port of the SWING engine), and `build_return_series`
  (maps the curated `symbol`/`units` book → aligned return series). No CSV/Excel
  upload — reads `st.session_state.portfolio` directly.
- `charts.create_benchmark_comparison_chart` — the normalized comparison line
  chart, re-themed to Obsidian Quant (amber portfolio, dotted cyan benchmark).

**Changed**

- Result tabs are now seven: Portfolio · Position Guide · **Analytics** · Regime ·
  Intelligence · Broker Sync · System.
- Regime tab hero row rebuilt as one self-contained HTML flex block (factor scores
  left, regime badge right, flush height) — reliable centring/alignment. Regime
  factor bars render as center-anchored diverging bars (signed [-2,+2]); badge
  background dimmed to a soft state-hue tint.

---

## [9.1.0] - 2026-07-01

### 🔗 Broker Sync — Curate → Sync → Execute

**Added**

- **Broker Sync tab** — writes the live curated portfolio's per-symbol units into
  broker order-template JSONs (e.g. Kite `ETF.json` → `params.quantity`), producing
  import-ready order files. Reads `st.session_state.portfolio` directly (no CSV
  re-upload); the natural final step of the flow. Absorbs the former standalone
  "Broker JSON Sync" utility. Result tabs are now six: Portfolio · Position Guide ·
  Regime · Intelligence · Broker Sync · System.
- The tab mirrors the Intelligence tab's layout exactly — a balanced two-column
  block (status card + uploader | results table + downloads) plus a full-width
  "How the Sync Works" method card — and reuses its CSS, so it reads as native
  Obsidian Quant chrome with no new styling primitives.

**Changed**

- Regime tab factor list now renders all eight factors (incl. Acceptance and
  Correlation) as a single deterministic block, and the regime badge card
  auto-sizes to sit level with it — fixing the height misalignment that appeared
  once the 7th/8th factors were surfaced. Badge content scaled up to fill the card.

**Fixed**

- File-uploader dropzone rendered unstyled on Streamlit 1.5x because the theme
  targeted the legacy `stFileUploadDropzone` test-id; now targets both the legacy
  and current (`stFileUploaderDropzone`) ids with a light-touch re-skin that
  preserves the native compact layout (fixes the oversized box, duplicated button
  label, and enlarged delete icons).

## [9.0.0] - 2026-07-01

### 📊 Value-Area Position (VAP) — Volume Profile as a Fifth Conviction Signal

**Architectural Thesis**

PRAGYAM had no notion of *where volume actually traded* — its only value anchor was
the rolling mean baked into the oscillator z-score. v9.0.0 ports the measured volume-
profile geometry from the Inferred-Delta indicator (POC + value area, no order-flow
inference) into a cross-sectional EOD feature and threads it through the whole engine.

**Added**

- **`backdata.compute_volume_profile()`** — rolling proxy-binned volume profile per
  symbol → `poc latest`, `vap latest` (volatility-normalised premium/discount to
  value), `va_pos latest` (position inside the value area). Added to `COLUMN_ORDER`.
- **Fifth conviction signal `vap_signal`** ∈ [-2, +2], in both `intelligence._signals_from_row`
  and `regime.compute_conviction_signals`. `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` is now an even 5-way
  `0.20 ×5`; the conviction calibrator optimises the **5-simplex** (`_softmax5`).
- **Learned regime-factor weights** — the 8 regime factors (incl. the new volume-
  profile **`acceptance`** factor) are no longer hardcoded. `intelligence.calibrate_regime_factors`
  learns them per `(universe, index)` by maximising the rank correlation of the
  composite regime score vs forward universe return, stored in a `RegimeFactorPassport`.
- **Structural selection** — `portfolio.compute_conviction_based_weights` breaks
  top-N conviction ties by value-area position (prefer discount to value).

**Changed**

- Regime detector is now **8-factor** (was 7); `MarketRegimeDetector.detect` accepts
  `(universe, selected_index, mode)` and resolves learned-or-default factor weights.
- UI swept end-to-end: Position Guide table gains a VAP column; conviction heatmap
  gains a Value Area row; Intelligence tab shows 5 active weights + the 5-simplex /
  regime-factor method copy; Regime tab shows the Acceptance factor with live
  (learned) weight percentages; System/landing cards, sidebar toggle help, README,
  and module docstrings updated.
- `PASSPORT_VERSION → v5-pragyam-conviction-vap` (auto-invalidates v4 passports).

**Fixed**

- `ui/theme.py` reads `theme.css` as UTF-8 (was crashing on Windows cp1252 default).

## [8.0.0] - 2026-05-11

### 🧠 Intelligence Mode — Per-(Universe, Index, Regime) Bayesian Calibration

**Architectural Thesis**

The four conviction signals (RSI, Oscillator, Z-Score, MA-alignment) were previously
combined with hard-coded weights `0.30 / 0.30 / 0.20 / 0.20`. v8.0.0 introduces a
self-tuning calibration layer that learns these four weights — on the 4-simplex
(sum-to-1, non-negative) — by maximising the cross-sectional Spearman Information
Ratio of the weighted conviction score against forward 10-day returns. Calibration
is keyed by the `(universe, selected_index, regime)` tuple, so a passport learned
on `India Indexes · NIFTY 500 · BEAR` is never silently applied to
`Commodities · GOLD · BEAR`.

### ✨ Added

**Intelligence Engine** (`intelligence.py`, new module — ~340 lines)
- 4-dim Bayesian search via Optuna TPE (seed=42 for reproducibility) over the
  conviction-weight simplex, parameterised through softmax of four unconstrained
  scalars
- Objective: mean per-date Spearman IC across all training dates, divided by IC
  std → Information Ratio (IR)
- Train / validation split by date (chronological, 70 / 30) — passports are saved
  only when validation IR is measurable on the held-out split
- Cross-sectional minimum (`MIN_XSECT = 5`) and total-dates minimum
  (`MIN_TOTAL_DATES = 20`) gates prevent calibrating on degenerate panels
- `IntelligencePassport(universe, selected_index, regime)` — JSON persistence at
  `.passports/passport_<universe>__<index>__<regime>.json`. Engine version
  (`v4-pragyam-conviction`) is recorded so future schema changes invalidate stale
  passports automatically
- `build_harvest(history_window, horizon)` — converts the Phase 1 indicator
  history into a flat (date, symbol) panel of signal values + forward returns
- Public API: `get_active_weights`, `calibrate`, `IntelligencePassport`,
  `passport_filename`, `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`, `DEFAULT_HORIZON`, `PASSPORT_VERSION`

**Phase 1.5 — Auto-Calibration**
- New phase between Phase 1 (data fetching) and Phase 2 (curation): when
  `intelligence_mode` is on and no passport exists for the current
  `(universe, index, regime)` tuple, the engine harvests the historical window
  and runs 100 Optuna trials before Phase 2 begins
- Subsequent runs skip calibration and reuse the saved passport
- Outcome (calibrated / reused / skipped / failed + reason + IRs) is mirrored to
  `st.session_state.last_intel_outcome` for surface in the UI
- Progress bar reports trial-by-trial: best-IR-so-far, dates / observation counts,
  and the final train/val IR + passport-save confirmation

**Sidebar — Model Passport Card**
- New panel below the **Run Analysis** button (mirrors Sanket's sidebar layout):
  - Profile state (`Default` / `Calibrated` / `Default · Off`) with `metric-card`
    success / warning / neutral accents
  - **Trained on** (universe or index, trimmed to 22 chars)
  - **Regime** (Pragyam analogue of Sanket's `Depth`)
  - **Train IR** and **Val IR** with emerald / rose colour coding
  - **Updated** timestamp
- **↑ Import Profile** — `st.file_uploader` accepts a passport JSON (full payload
  or a bare `{"weights": {...}}` dict) and writes it through `IntelligencePassport.save`
- **↓ Export Profile** — `st.download_button` serialising the active passport
  (or a defaults-shape envelope when none exists). Filename:
  `pragyam_profile_<universe>__<index>__<regime>__<YYYYMMDD>.json`
- **↺ Reset to Defaults** — deletes the passport file for the current scope only
  (other scopes' passports are untouched)
- **Intelligence Mode toggle** — turns the calibration layer on/off; when off the
  card greys to neutral and conviction reverts to canonical defaults

**Intelligence Tab** (Result page)
- Calibration status card with full metrics (train IR · val IR · n_train_dates ·
  n_val_dates · horizon · n_trials · engine version)
- Manual **Calibrate** / **Reset** controls
- **Explicit fallback messaging**: when calibration was attempted but skipped or
  failed (e.g., insufficient history, sparse harvest, validation IR not
  measurable), the tab shows the specific reason instead of silently reverting to
  defaults

**Persistence**
- `.passports/` directory holds one JSON per `(universe, index, regime)` scope
- Passport schema includes calibrated weights, train / val IR, n dates, horizon,
  n_trials, ISO timestamp, engine version, and the scope tuple itself

### 🔧 Changed

**`regime.compute_conviction_signals(...)`**
- New signature: `compute_conviction_signals(portfolio, current_df, universe,
  selected_index, regime_name, mode)` — was `(portfolio, current_df, regime_name,
  mode)`
- Reads weights via `intelligence.get_active_weights(universe, selected_index,
  regime_name, mode)`. Standard mode returns canonical 0.30 / 0.30 / 0.20 / 0.20;
  Intelligence mode returns per-scope calibrated weights, falling back to defaults
  when no passport exists

**`portfolio.compute_conviction_based_weights(...)`**
- New `universe` and `selected_index` keyword parameters threaded through to
  `compute_conviction_signals`

**Phase 1.5 → automatic `st.rerun()` after first calibration**
- The sidebar Model Passport card paints before Phase 1.5 runs. To avoid the
  card showing stale "NOT CALIBRATED" pixels after a passport is saved mid-run,
  Phase 1.5 issues a single `st.rerun()` on first calibration. The script
  re-enters with `run_analysis` still True, the data cache is hit instantly,
  Phase 1.5 takes the reuse path, and Phase 2 curates the portfolio with the
  freshly-saved passport active. Adds ~2–4s of cache-hit work, eliminates the
  stale-sidebar surprise. Subsequent runs (passport already exists) skip the
  rerun entirely

**Conviction dispersion is no longer overridden by passports**
- Earlier prototypes attempted to "calibrate" the dispersion multipliers
  (`boost_mult`, `penalty_mult`) through the passport. Those values are a
  user-facing risk preference (SIP vs Swing concentration), not something to
  learn from forward returns; v8.0.0 keeps dispersion strictly style-aware

### 🚀 Performance

- Calibration runs in ~5–10s for typical lookbacks (100 days × 50–500 symbols ×
  100 Optuna trials), then never again for the same `(universe, index, regime)`
- Reuse-path Run Analysis is unchanged from v7.x (~20–40s)
- First-time-on-a-scope Run Analysis adds calibration time on top

### 📦 Dependencies

- **Added:** `optuna>=3.5.0` (Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation, TPE sampler)

### 🗂 Module Structure

- **New:** `intelligence.py` — calibration engine and passport persistence
- **New runtime artefact:** `.passports/` (one JSON per `(universe, index, regime)`)

### ⚠️ Migration Notes

- **Breaking signature change** for `regime.compute_conviction_signals` and
  `portfolio.compute_conviction_based_weights`. Callers must pass `universe` and
  `selected_index`. The default values (`"default"` / `None`) mean code that
  hasn't been updated still runs but will route all calibrations to a single
  generic scope. Update callers to thread the real universe context for proper
  per-universe isolation
- **Stale passports from earlier prototypes are auto-rejected.** The
  `IntelligencePassport.exists()` check verifies `engine_version ==
  PASSPORT_VERSION`, so any v3.0-sanket-fidelity or unkeyed
  `passport_<regime>.json` files are ignored at load time. Safe to delete

---

## [7.0.4] - 2026-04-02

### ✨ Added

**Style-Aware Conviction Dispersion**

Different dispersion profiles for SIP vs Swing Trading investment styles:

| Style | Boost | Penalty | Top Pick Advantage | Use Case |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **SIP Investment** | +125% (×2.25) | -50% (×0.50) | ~350% more weight | Long-term wealth building |
| **Swing Trading** | +225% (×3.25) | -75% (×0.25) | ~1200% more weight | Active trading, alpha capture |

**Formula:**
```python
# Auto-selected based on investment_style parameter

# SIP Mode (conservative concentration)
if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 2.25  # +125% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.50  # -50% penalty

# Swing Mode (aggressive, 2σ more concentration)
if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 3.25  # +225% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.25  # -75% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- SIP: Strong concentration with moderate risk (~350% tilt to top picks)
- Swing: Maximum concentration in best ideas (~1200% tilt) for alpha capture
- Both maintain 30-position diversification with 1-10% bounds

### 🔧 Changed

- `portfolio.py::compute_conviction_based_weights()` now accepts `investment_style` parameter
- Dispersion auto-selects based on style when `dispersion_params=None`

---

## [7.0.3] - 2026-04-02

### 🔧 Changed

**Aggressive Conviction Dispersion**

Maximum concentration in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+75% boost** (was +40%)
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-50% penalty** (was -30%)

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.75  # +75% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.50  # -50% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~250% more weight vs linear allocation
- Aggressive concentration in best ideas while maintaining 30-position diversification
- Configurable via `dispersion_params` tuple in `portfolio.py`

---

## [7.0.2] - 2026-04-02

### 🔧 Changed

**Increased Conviction Dispersion**

Stronger concentration in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+40% boost** (was +15%)
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-30% penalty** (was -10%)

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.40  # +40% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.70  # -30% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~100% more weight vs linear allocation
- Strong concentration in best ideas while maintaining 30-position diversification
- Configurable via `dispersion_params` tuple in `portfolio.py`

---

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-02

### ✨ Added

**Conviction Dispersion Weighting**

To concentrate capital in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+15% boost**
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-10% penalty**

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.15  # Boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.90  # Penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~28% more weight vs linear allocation
- Maintains diversification (still 30 positions)
- Preserves bounds (1% min, 10% max)

### 🔧 Changed

- `portfolio.py::compute_conviction_based_weights()` now has `apply_dispersion` parameter (default: `True`)
- Version bumped to 7.0.1 across all files

---

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-02

### 🎯 Major Changes
